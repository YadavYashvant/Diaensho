## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architecture

This project showcases a modern, robust Android architecture designed for scalability and maintainability.

* **UI**: **Jetpack Compose** for a fully declarative and modern UI.
* **Architecture**: **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** to separate UI logic from business logic.
* **Asynchronous Programming**: **Kotlin Coroutines & Flow** for managing all background tasks and reactive data streams.
* **Dependency Injection**: **Hilt** for managing dependencies and simplifying the app's structure.
* **Database**: **Room** for robust, offline-first data persistence.
* **Networking**: **Retrofit & Moshi** for type-safe communication with the backend REST API.
* **Background Processing**:
    * **Foreground Service** for the persistent hotword listener.
    * **WorkManager** for reliable, scheduled tasks like screen time tracking and data synchronization.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get the project up and running, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

* Android Studio Iguana | 2023.2.1 or later.
* JDK 17 or later.
* A running instance of the [Cogniscribe Backend Service](https://github.com/your-username/cogniscribe-backend) (link is a placeholder).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/cogniscribe-android.git](https://github.com/your-username/cogniscribe-android.git)
    ```

2.  **Configure the Backend URL:**
    Create a `local.properties` file in the root of the project and add the base URL of your running backend instance:
    ```properties
    BACKEND_URL="[http://10.0.2.2:8080](http://10.0.2.2:8080)"
    ```
    *(Note: `10.0.2.2` is the standard alias for the host machine's localhost when running in the Android Emulator.)*

3.  **Build and Run:**
    Open the project in Android Studio, let Gradle sync, and run the app on an emulator or a physical device.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Required Permissions

Cogniscribe requires two sensitive permissions to deliver its core functionality:

* **Microphone (`RECORD_AUDIO`)**: This is essential for the hotword detection and voice capture features. The microphone is only actively recording after the "Dear diary" hotword is detected.
* **Usage Stats (`ACTION_USAGE_ACCESS_SETTINGS`)**: This is required to track application screen time. The app will guide you to the system settings screen to enable this permission, as it cannot be granted at runtime directly.

We are committed to your privacy. All data is stored securely and is only used to provide the app's features.
